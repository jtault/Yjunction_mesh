* Synopsis

  This repository contains files for T-junction mesh generation and case setup.

* Mesh generation

  To generate the mesh, run "make" from the root directory.  Then, set the inlet
  boundary condition using the setInletVelocity application and the
  constant/inletDict dictionary.  The parameters of the mesh can be edited in
  constant/polyMesh/generate_blockMeshDict.

* Utilities

  simpleGrading.py is a Python3 utility for computing a cell dimension in a
  simple-graded block.
